## üê≥ Local Development

### Backend (Docker)

Run `cd backend` to navigate to the backend directory.

Run `docker compose up --build`

This will:

- Start a PostgreSQL container
- Start a backend server container
- Seed the database with products
- Automatically connect backend to the database via Docker networking

### Frontend (Without Docker)
Navigate to frontend folder:

- Run `cd frontend` to navigate to the frontend directory:

Install dependencies:

- Run `npm install`

Start frontend:

- Run `npm start`

### Frontend (Docker)
Navigate to frontend folder:

- Run `cd frontend` to navigate to the frontend directory:

- Run `docker compose up --build`

- Open a tab in your prowser and paste `http://localhost:3001/`

### Postman API Tests

Install Newman globally (if not already installed):

- `npm install -g newman`

- Run Postman collection in the backend directory:

  `npm run test:postman`

Ensure backend is running (via Docker) before running tests.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS Deployment
This project is deployed to AWS using best practices for scalability, security, and high availability.

Architecture Highlights:

- ECS Fargate for containerized backend tasks in private subnets

- Application Load Balancer (ALB) in public subnets for secure, scalable routing

- Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL) Multi-AZ for fault-tolerant relational database backend

- Amazon ECR for container image hosting

- Amazon S3 + CloudFront for static frontend hosting and CDN caching

- VPC Endpoints (PrivateLink) for ECS ‚Üî ECR/S3 access without NAT Gateway

- CI/CD Pipeline integrated with GitHub ‚Üí automated Postman tests ‚Üí build & push Docker images to ECR ‚Üí ECS service deployment
